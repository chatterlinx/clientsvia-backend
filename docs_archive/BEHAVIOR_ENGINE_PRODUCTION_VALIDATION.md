### ðŸ§ª API Testing Results

#### 1. Behavior Detection API (`/api/ai-agent/test-behavior`)
- **Status**: âœ… WORKING
- **Test Case**: Frustration detection with query "I am so frustrated with this service, it never works!"
- **Result**: Successfully detected frustration with keywords ["frustrated"]
- **Response**: Proper de-escalation message and transfer logic triggered

#### 2. Twilio Integration (`/api/twilio/handle-speech`)
- **Status**: âœ… WORKING
- **Test Case**: Speech input with frustration content
- **Result**: Middleware processing speech input successfully
- **Integration**: Behavior engine middleware active in call flow
