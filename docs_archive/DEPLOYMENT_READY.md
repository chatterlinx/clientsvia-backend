# DEPLOYMENT READY - SERVICE TYPE MANAGER FIX

## Changes Made
✅ **Fixed Service Type Manager Backend Issue**
- Fixed MongoDB driver compatibility in `/api/trade-categories/update-service-types` endpoint
- Added support for both `result.value` and direct `result` formats from `findOneAndUpdate`
- Removed debug logging for production readiness
- Endpoint now properly saves service types to `tradeCategories` collection

## Files Modified
- `routes/tradeCategories.js` - Fixed update-service-types endpoint

## Testing Status
✅ **Local Testing Complete**
- Endpoint responding correctly: `POST /api/trade-categories/update-service-types`
- Service types saving to database successfully
- Both "HVAC" and "HVAC Residential" categories working
- Returns proper success response with updated data

## Deployment Requirements
- Node.js application
- MongoDB connection required
- Environment variables from `clientsvia-env-group`

## Manual Deployment Instructions
1. Ensure latest code is pulled from main branch
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Ensure MongoDB connection is available
4. Start with `npm start` or `node server.js`
5. Verify endpoint works: `curl -X POST [domain]/api/trade-categories/update-service-types`

## Expected Behavior After Deployment
- Service Type Manager (Per Trade) should save service types without errors
- Service types should appear in Booking Script Configuration dropdown
- No more "Trade category not found" errors when saving

## Git Status

- Latest commit: Fix update-service-types endpoint MongoDB driver compatibility

## Critical Fix Summary
