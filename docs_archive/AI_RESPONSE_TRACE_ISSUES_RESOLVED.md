# 🎯 AI Response Trace Logger - ISSUES RESOLVED ✅

## 🐛 **Issues Fixed**

### ❌ **Issue 1: "customKBResult.substring is not a function"**
**Problem:** Backend `agent.js` was trying to call `.substring()` on an object instead of a string.
**Solution:** Updated `checkCustomKB` integration to handle both old format (string) and new format (`{result, trace}` object).

```javascript
// Before (broken):
if (customKBResult) {
    console.log(`Found match: "${customKBResult.substring(0, 100)}..."`);
}

// After (fixed):
const customKBResponse = customKBResult?.result || customKBResult;
if (customKBResponse) {
    console.log(`Found match: "${customKBResponse.substring(0, 100)}..."`);
}
```

### ❌ **Issue 2: "testCustomKBWithTrace is not defined"**
**Problem:** Frontend HTML was calling a function that didn't exist.
**Solution:** Added complete `testCustomKBWithTrace()` and `displayCustomKBTraceResults()` functions to the frontend.

## ✅ **What's Working Now**

### 🎮 **Test Intelligence Engine Panel**
- ✅ **"Test Super AI Intelligence"** button - Tests overall AI intelligence
- ✅ **"Test Custom KB + Trace"** button - Shows step-by-step trace log
- ✅ **Visual trace display** with confidence bars and match details
- ✅ **Error handling** for both buttons

### 🔧 **Backend Integration**  
- ✅ **Backwards compatibility** - Works with both old and new Custom KB formats
- ✅ **Trace logging** - Complete step-by-step source checking
- ✅ **API endpoints** - Both `/test-intelligence` and `/test-custom-kb-trace` functional
- ✅ **Error handling** - Proper error messages and logging

3. Enter test query: `"my thermostat is blank"`
4. Click **"Test Custom KB + Trace"**

### 3. **Expected Results**
You should see:
- **Step 1: Company Category Q&As** ✅ MATCHED (90% confidence)
- **Step 2: Service Issue Handler** ❌ NO MATCH (0% confidence)  
- **Step 3: Trade Category Database** ❌ NO MATCH (0% confidence)
- **Selected Response:** Full thermostat troubleshooting answer
- **Performance metrics:** Response time, sources checked, confidence scores
