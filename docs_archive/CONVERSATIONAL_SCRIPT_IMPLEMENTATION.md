# Structured Conversational Script System - Implementation Summary

## Problem Solved
The AI agent was not following the "Main Conversational Script / Knowledge" section in the Agent Setup tab, despite companies configuring detailed scripts for call handling. The agent would respond to questions but wouldn't follow a structured conversational flow for greetings, booking procedures, transfers, and call closings.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Structured Call Flow Processing
- **Call Intent Analysis**: Automatically detects if caller wants booking, transfer, emergency service, or information
- **Call Stage Detection**: Tracks conversation progress (greeting → intent detection → booking flow → confirmation → closing)
- **Script-Based Responses**: Uses company-specific conversational scripts instead of generic AI responses

### 2. Enhanced Script Parsing
- **Section Recognition**: Parses script sections like "Greeting:", "Service Booking:", "Transfer Handling:"
- **Agent Dialogue Extraction**: Extracts responses marked with "Agent:" for structured flow
- **Q&A Integration**: Handles information responses in Q&A format within the script
- **Placeholder Support**: Applies company placeholders like {CompanyName}, {AgentName}

### 3. Natural Conversation Flow
The agent now follows this structured flow:

**1. Greeting & Identification**
```
Agent: Hi, {CompanyName}! How can I help you today?
```

**2. Intent Detection & Routing**
- **Booking Intent**: "Of course! I can help you schedule an appointment."
- **Transfer Intent**: "I can take a message and have a technician call you back."
- **Emergency Intent**: "I understand this is urgent. Let me connect you with emergency service."

**3. Service Booking Flow**
- Collects name → phone → service type → preferred time
- Follows natural progression with confirmation
- Uses personality-aware responses

**4. Confirmation & Closing**
- Repeats back information for confirmation
- Provides confirmation details
- Ends with appropriate closing message

### 4. Admin UI Enhancement
- **Better Script Guidance**: Enhanced textarea with comprehensive example structure
- **Section Examples**: Shows how to structure Greeting, Service Booking, Transfer Handling, etc.
- **Increased Rows**: Expanded textarea from 10 to 15 rows for better script visibility

## Technical Implementation

### New Functions Added to `services/agent.js`:

1. **`processConversationalScriptEnhanced()`** - Main script processor with parsing
2. **`parseMainScript()`** - Parses structured script content into sections
3. **`analyzeCallIntent()`** - Detects caller intent (booking, transfer, emergency, information)
4. **`determineCallStage()`** - Tracks conversation progress through call stages
5. **`handleGreeting()`** - Manages greeting responses with personality
6. **`handleIntentDetection()`** - Routes based on detected intent
7. **`handleBookingFlow()`** - Manages appointment booking conversation
8. **`handleConfirmation()`** - Handles appointment confirmation dialogue
9. **`handleClosing()`** - Manages call closing with appropriate responses

### Integration Points
- **Priority Processing**: Script-based responses take priority over generic AI responses
- **Fallback System**: Falls back to Q&A matching and AI generation if script doesn't cover scenario
- **Personality Integration**: Uses personality-specific responses where appropriate
- **Placeholder Support**: Applies company-specific placeholders throughout

### Script Format Example
Companies can now structure their scripts like this:

```
Greeting & Identification:
Agent: Hi, Penguin Air Conditioning! How can I help you today?

Service Booking:
Agent: Of course! I can help you schedule an appointment. May I have your full name and the best phone number to reach you?
Agent: What service do you need? (Options: AC repair, maintenance, duct cleaning, estimate)
Agent: Which days and times work best for you? We offer morning (8-10, 10-12) and afternoon (12-2, 2-4) slots.

Transfer Handling:
Agent: I can take a message and have a technician call you back as soon as possible. May I have your name and phone number?

Information Responses:
Do you offer emergency service? Yes, we offer 24/7 emergency AC repair.
What areas do you serve? We serve all of Maricopa County including Phoenix, Tempe, Mesa.
Are you licensed and insured? Yes, we are fully licensed, bonded, and insured.

Closing:
Agent: Thank you for calling Penguin Air Conditioning. Have a great day!
```
