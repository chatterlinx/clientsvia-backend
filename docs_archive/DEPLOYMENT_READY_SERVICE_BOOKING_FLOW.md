## 🔄 **Exact Flow Implemented**

```
Caller: "My AC stopped working this morning."
➤ intent = category_service_issue
➤ System routes to: check_custom_KB() → check_category_QAs() → escalate_to_booking()
➤ Response: "I'm sorry to hear that! Let's get you scheduled — is this your home or business?"
➤ System then flows into address collection, technician match, available time blocks, and books the job.
```

### **Complete Booking Process**
1. **Service Issue Detection** - AC/heating issues trigger booking flow
2. **Address Collection** - "Home or business?"
3. **Location Details** - "What's the address?"
4. **Contact Information** - "Phone number?"
5. **Availability** - "Today or tomorrow?"
6. **Confirmation** - Generate booking reference and complete
