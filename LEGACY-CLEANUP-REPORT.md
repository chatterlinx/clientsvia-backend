## üóëÔ∏è FILES SAFE TO DELETE

### 1. ONE-TIME FIX SCRIPTS (No Longer Needed)

These scripts were used to fix specific issues and are no longer needed:

```
scripts/check-legacy-greeting.js
scripts/delete-legacy-greeting.js
scripts/emergency-fix-voice-settings.js
scripts/find-legacy-default-string.js
scripts/fix-royal-plumbing-legacy.js
scripts/fix-corrupt-company-data.js
scripts/force-delete-legacy.js
scripts/nuclear-fallback-cleanup.js
scripts/migrate-fallback-to-object.js
scripts/migrate-voice-settings-schema.js
scripts/initialize-royal-plumbing.js
scripts/update-royal-greeting.js
scripts/verify-fallback-clean.js
```

**Reason:** These were one-time migration/fix scripts used during development. Issues are now resolved.

---

### 2. LEGACY DIAGNOSTIC SCRIPTS (Replaced by Better Tools)

These diagnostics have been replaced by newer, better scripts:

```
scripts/find-atlas-air.js
scripts/find-royal-plumbing.js
scripts/verify-royal-plumbing.js
scripts/show-exact-greeting.js
scripts/verify-greeting-system.js
scripts/test-summary-endpoint.js
scripts/diagnose-connection-messages-full.js
scripts/diagnose-data-center-counts.js
scripts/production-datacenter-diagnostic.js
```

**Reason:** Replaced by `check-all-companies.js`, `hard-search-company.js`, and Data Center UI.

---

### 3. OLD COMPANY-SPECIFIC SCRIPTS (Companies No Longer Exist)

These were for companies that have been deleted:

```
scripts/create-royal-plumbing.js
```

**Reason:** Royal Plumbing now exists properly. This seed script is no longer needed.

---

### 4. ROOT-LEVEL DOCUMENTATION (Should Be in /docs/)

These markdown files should be moved to /docs/ or deleted:

```
FINAL-PRODUCTION-AUDIT-2025-10-16.md
GREETING-SYSTEM-COMPLETE.md
```

**Reason:** Consolidate documentation in one place.
