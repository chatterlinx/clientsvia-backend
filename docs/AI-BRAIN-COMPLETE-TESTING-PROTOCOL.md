## **PHASE 2: TIER 1 TESTING (RULE-BASED)** (10 minutes)

### **Purpose:** Verify that well-matched scenarios trigger Tier 1 (free, fast)

### **Test 2.1: Perfect Match Scenario**

**Setup:**
1. Go to Global AI Brain
2. Select your HVAC template (or active template)
3. Verify you have scenarios for "Appointment Booking"

**Test Call:**
1. Call test pilot number: `[YOUR_TEST_NUMBER]`
2. When prompted, say clearly: **"I need to schedule an appointment"**

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Response within **50-100ms**
- ✅ System matches "Appointment Booking" scenario
- ✅ Correct response is spoken back

**Verification:**
1. Go to **Test Call Log** in Global AI Brain
2. Find your call
3. Check details:

**Verification:**
- Check Test Call Log
- Confirm all 3 calls show `Tier: 1`

---

## **PHASE 3: TIER 2 TESTING (SEMANTIC)** (10 minutes)

### **Purpose:** Verify that ambiguous queries trigger Tier 2 (semantic matching)

### **Test 3.1: Paraphrased Query**

**Test Call:**
- Call test pilot
- Say: **"Can someone come look at my system tomorrow?"**

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Tier 1 may not match (keywords not exact)
- ✅ Tier 2 SHOULD match "Service Request" or "Appointment Booking"
- ✅ Confidence: 0.60-0.79
- ✅ Cost: $0.00 (still free)
- ✅ Response Time: 100-200ms

**Verification:**
- Check Test Call Log
- Look for `Tier: 2`
- Confidence should be between 0.60-0.79

**Console Logs to Look For:**
```
⚠️ [TIER 1] Below threshold, escalating to Tier 2
✅ [TIER 2] Semantic match succeeded
   confidence: 0.72
   scenario: "Service Request"
   responseTime: 142ms
   cost: $0.00
```

---

## **PHASE 4: TIER 3 TESTING (LLM - CRITICAL)** (15 minutes)

### **Purpose:** Verify LLM kicks in for novel/complex queries AND learns patterns

### **Test 4.1: Completely Novel Query (Missing Scenario)**

**Test Call:**

- Say: **"Does my warranty cover a compressor replacement if the unit is 8 years old?"**

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Tier 1: ❌ NO MATCH (no warranty scenario)
- ✅ Tier 2: ❌ NO MATCH (no semantic match)
- ✅ Tier 3: ✅ LLM FALLBACK ACTIVATED
- ✅ Response Time: 1000-2000ms (slower, but intelligent)
- ✅ Cost: $0.02-0.05 (LLM cost)

**Verification - Test Call Log:**
1. Find the call
2. Check details:
   - `Tier Used: 3`
   - `Confidence: 0.70+`
   - `Cost: $0.02-0.05`
   - `Response Time: 1000-2000ms`
   - `Patterns Learned: 1-3 patterns`

**Verification - Console Logs:**

⚠️ [TIER 1] Below threshold, escalating to Tier 2
⚠️ [TIER 2] Below threshold, escalating to Tier 3 (LLM - EXPENSIVE!)
🤖 [TIER 3 LLM] Starting analysis
   model: gpt-4-turbo-preview
✅ [TIER 3 LLM] Analysis complete
   matched: true
   confidence: 0.87
   patternsExtracted: 2
   cost: $0.0125
   responseTime: 1543ms
🧠 [LEARNING] LLM extracted patterns, teaching Tier 1...
✅ [LEARNING] Patterns applied to Tier 1
   patternsApplied: 2
   note: Next call with these patterns will be FREE (Tier 1)
```

**Verification - Notification Center:**
1. Open Notification Center
2. Look for alert: `AI_LEARNING_PATTERN_LEARNED`
3. Details should show:
   - Template: "HVAC Template"
   - Pattern Type: "synonym" or "keyword"
   - Confidence: 0.80+
   - Source: "LLM (Tier 3)"

---

### **Test 4.2: Pattern Learning Verification**

**Purpose:** Verify that LLM patterns ACTUALLY teach Tier 1

**Test Call #1 (First Time - LLM):**
- Say: **"My thingy on the wall is not working"**

**Expected:**
- ✅ Tier 3 (LLM) handles it
- ✅ Cost: $0.02-0.05
- ✅ LLM learns: "thingy" = "thermostat"

**Wait 30 seconds for pattern to be applied**

**Test Call #2 (Second Time - Should be Tier 1!):**
- Say: **"My thingy on the wall is not working"** (EXACT SAME PHRASE)

**Expected:**
- ✅ Tier 1 handles it (FREE!)
- ✅ Cost: $0.00
- ✅ Response Time: < 100ms
- ✅ Matches "Thermostat Issues" scenario

**This proves the learning system works!**

---

### **Test 4.3: Complex Multi-Intent Query**

**Test Call:**

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Tier 1/2: Likely fail (too complex, multiple intents)
- ✅ Tier 3: Handles it intelligently
- ✅ LLM extracts:
  - **Primary Intent:** "Service Request / Emergency"
  - **Secondary Intent:** "Brand/Equipment Question"
  - **Fillers Detected:** "yeah", "so like", "you know"
  - **Synonyms Detected:** "weird noise" → "unusual sound"

**Verification:**
- Check patterns learned

**Example Queries:**
1. "Do you offer maintenance plans?"
2. "What brands do you service?"
3. "Can I get a quote over the phone?"
4. "Do you do commercial work?"
5. "Are you licensed and insured?"

**Expected:**
- ✅ All calls use Tier 3 (LLM)

- ✅ Suggestion cards are displayed

**Example Suggestion Card:**
```
🔴 HIGH PRIORITY (95% confidence)
Add Missing Keyword: "maintenance plans"

Impact: ~15% of calls
Frequency: 5 calls in last hour
Confidence: 95%

[View Analysis] [Apply] [Ignore]
```

---

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Green toast: "Suggestion applied successfully!"
- ✅ Template updated (new keyword added)
- ✅ Suggestion removed from list
- ✅ Notification sent to Notification Center

**Verification:**
1. Go to relevant scenario
2. Check if keyword was added
3. Make a test call with that keyword
4. Should now match Tier 1 (FREE!)

---

      timestamp: { $gte: new Date('2025-10-28T00:00:00Z') }
    }
  },
  {
    $group: {
      _id: null,
      totalCalls: { $sum: 1 },
      totalCost: { $sum: '$totalCost' }
    }
  }
])
