#### **MODAL SECTION 4: LLM Reasoning & Analysis**

**Section Header:**
- [ ] Title: "üß† LLM REASONING & ANALYSIS"
- [ ] Subtitle: "GPT-4 interpretation and pattern detection"

**Analysis Details:**
- [ ] Model: "GPT-4-turbo" (or actual model used)
- [ ] Analysis time: "X.Xs"
- [ ] Confidence: "XX%"
- [ ] Token count: "XXX tokens"
- [ ] Cost: "$0.XX"

- [ ] Full LLM explanation (multi-paragraph)
- [ ] Formatted: Line breaks, bullet points preserved
- [ ] Highlights: Bold for key terms

  - [ ] "Context Clues Detected" (what LLM noticed)
  - [ ] "Pattern Recognition" (similar calls)
  - [ ] "Root Cause of Tier 1/2 Failure" (why rule-based failed)
  - [ ] "Business Impact" (cost, performance, customer experience)

**Example:**
```
The caller used highly colloquial language to describe a thermostat:

Context Clues Detected:
‚Ä¢ Location: 'on the wall' ‚Üí thermostats are wall-mounted
‚Ä¢ Function: 'controls temperature' ‚Üí primary thermostat purpose
‚Ä¢ Symptom: 'needs batteries' ‚Üí common thermostat issue
‚Ä¢ Alternative names: 'thingy' ‚Üí indicates unfamiliarity with technical terms

Pattern Recognition:
Similar calls detected in database: 12 instances this month
Common phrases: 'wall thing', 'temperature box', 'controller'

Root Cause of Tier 1/2 Failure:
Rule-based system requires technical vocabulary. Semantic matching failed
due to lack of synonym mapping for colloquial terms.

Business Impact:
Each LLM fallback costs $0.47. With 12 similar calls/month, total cost
is $5.64/month that could be saved with proper synonym mapping.

- [ ] Error handling: Log to Notification Center, retry 3x, then skip
- [ ] Performance: Process in background queue (not blocking)

**GPT-4 Analysis Prompt:**
```
You are analyzing a customer service call where the AI agent used expensive
LLM fallback (Tier 3) instead of cheaper rule-based or semantic matching.

Your task: Identify specific improvements to prevent future LLM calls.

Call Details:
- Transcript: [full transcript]
- Tier 1 Result: [confidence, why it failed]
- Tier 2 Result: [confidence, why it failed]
- Tier 3 Result: [what LLM matched]

Analyze and return JSON:
