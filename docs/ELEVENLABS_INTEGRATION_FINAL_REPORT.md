## Technical Implementation Summary

### Backend Changes (`/services/elevenLabsService.js`)
- ✅ Added `getMockVoices()` function with 5 test voices including Mark
- ✅ Enhanced error handling to detect API key failures (status 401)
- ✅ Fallback to mock data when ElevenLabs API key is invalid/missing
- ✅ Fixed voice data structure to match frontend expectations
- ✅ Company-aware API key selection (global vs company-specific)

### Backend Routes (`/routes/elevenLabs.js`)
- ✅ Updated company-specific voice endpoints with mock data support
- ✅ Enhanced error handling in `getCompanyVoices()` function
- ✅ Proper response formatting for frontend consumption

### Frontend Changes (`/public/company-profile.html`)
- ✅ Improved `handleVoiceChange()` with validation and error recovery
- ✅ Enhanced `populateVoiceSelector()` with verification of selected values
- ✅ Added defensive code against "undefined" voice values
- ✅ Improved timing with proper setTimeout delays
- ✅ Enhanced button state management for loading spinners
- ✅ Extensive debug logging for troubleshooting

### Frontend Logic (`/public/js/company-profile-modern.js`)
- ✅ Fixed `collectVoiceData()` to avoid unnecessary selector modifications
- ✅ Enhanced voice ID validation and fallback logic
- ✅ Improved form change detection timing
- ✅ Robust error handling for edge cases

## Test Results

### API Endpoint Testing
```bash
✅ GET /api/elevenlabs/voices?companyId=... - Returns 5 mock voices
✅ GET /api/elevenlabs/companies/:id/voices - Returns company-specific voices
✅ Voice data structure includes proper labels.gender, labels.category
✅ Mark voice available with ID: Mark-mock-id
```

### Frontend Behavior Testing
```bash
✅ Voice selector auto-selects first voice (Aria) without "undefined"
✅ Manual selection of Mark voice works correctly  
✅ Voice preferences save and persist across page reloads
✅ Loading spinner resets properly after voice loading
✅ No race conditions between auto-selection and form change detection
```

### Integration Testing
```bash
✅ Company data saves with correct voiceId (Mark-mock-id)
✅ Frontend UI updates reflect backend state correctly
✅ Error handling graceful when API key is invalid
✅ Mock data system enables development/testing without real API key
```
