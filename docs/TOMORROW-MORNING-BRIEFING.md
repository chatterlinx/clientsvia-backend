---

## 🔧 CRITICAL FIXES APPLIED (Last Night)

### **Bug Fixes:**
1. ✅ HTTP method mismatch (added PUT route alongside PATCH)
2. ✅ Data structure mismatch (blacklist/whitelist now return strings, not objects)
3. ✅ Redis cache invalidation (added to ALL 5 spam filter routes)
4. ✅ Missing whitelist routes (added POST & DELETE for company whitelist)

### **Quick Wins:**
1. ✅ Mongoose `autoIndex: true` enabled (all indexes will auto-create)
2. ✅ Response status checking in AI Performance Dashboard
3. ✅ Health check endpoint (`/api/health` and `/api/ping`)
4. ✅ Test data seeder script (`scripts/seed-test-calls.js`)

---

## 🚀 START-UP PROCEDURE (5 minutes)

### **Step 1: Start Backend Server (1 min)**
```bash
cd /Users/marc/MyProjects/clientsvia-backend
npm start
```

**Look for these logs:**
```
[Mongoose] ✅ Auto-index enabled - all schema indexes will be created
[Mongoose Connection] [OK] Successfully connected to MongoDB via Mongoose!
[INIT] ✅ All routes loaded successfully
[INIT] ✅ healthRoutes loaded
Server running on port 5000
```

---

### **Step 2: Health Check (30 seconds)**

**Open browser:**
```
http://localhost:5000/api/health
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
    "status": "ok",
    "timestamp": "2025-10-21T...",
    "systems": {
        "mongodb": "ok",
        "redis": "ok",
        "aiPerformance": "ok",
        "callArchives": "ok",
        "spamFilter": "ok"
    },
    "details": {
        "callArchives": {
            "textIndexExists": true,  // ← CRITICAL! Must be true
            "message": "Search ready"
        }
    }
}
```

**If `textIndexExists: false`:**
- Text search won't work
- Mongoose might need a few seconds to create indexes
- Wait 10 seconds, refresh health check
- If still false, manually run: `node scripts/verify-indexes.js` (doesn't exist yet - see workaround below)

**Workaround if needed:**
```bash
# In MongoDB shell or Compass
use clientsvia
db.v2aiagentcalllogs.createIndex({ "conversation.fullTranscript.plainText": "text" })
```

---

### **Step 3: Seed Test Data (30 seconds)**

```bash
node scripts/seed-test-calls.js
```

**Expected Output:**
```
✅ Connected to MongoDB
✅ Using company: [Company Name] ([ID])
✅ Created 20 call logs

📊 BREAKDOWN:
   - High Confidence (>0.9): 15
   - Medium Confidence (0.7-0.9): 4
   - Low Confidence (<0.7): 1

   - Company Q&A: 9
   - Trade Q&A: 8
   - Templates: 3
   - Fallback: 1

   - Positive: 12
   - Neutral: 7
   - Negative: 1

🎉 Seeding complete!
```

**If error "No company found":**
- Create a test company first via Add Company page
- Or use existing company from database

---

### **Step 4: Quick Smoke Test (3 min)**

1. **Open Call Archives:**
   ```
   http://localhost:5000/admin-call-archives.html
   ```

2. **Test search:**
   - Search for "emergency" → Should find 2 calls
   - Search for "plumbing" → Should find multiple
   - Click "View" on any call → Should show transcript modal
   - Click "Export CSV" → Should download file

3. **If search returns nothing:**
   - Check health endpoint → `textIndexExists` should be `true`
   - Check browser console for errors
   - Check backend logs for search errors

**If all 4 steps pass, YOU'RE READY TO TEST!** ✅

## 🧪 TESTING ORDER (2 hours)

### **Phase 1: System 1 - AI Performance Dashboard (30 min)**

**Access:**
1. Go to Company Profile of test company
2. Click "AI Performance" tab

**Test Cases:**
- ✅ Dashboard loads without errors
- ✅ All 4 stat cards display (may show 0s if no AI calls yet)
- ✅ Charts render without errors
- ✅ Auto-refresh works (every 30 seconds)
- ✅ No 500 errors in console (response validation should catch these!)

**Make AI calls to populate data:**
- If you have phone system: Call the test company
- Or simulate AI calls via backend API

**Common Issues:**
- Dashboard stuck loading → Check backend logs
- "No auth token" → Clear cookies, re-login
- 500 errors → Check which API failed (response validation will show)

---

### **Phase 2: System 2 - Call Archives (30 min)**

**Access:**
1. From any admin page → Click "Call Archives" in nav
2. Or go directly: `http://localhost:5000/admin-call-archives.html`

**Test Cases:**
- ✅ Page loads with 4 stat cards
- ✅ Search box and filter dropdowns appear
- ✅ Search for "emergency" → Should find calls
- ✅ Filter by company → Results update
- ✅ Filter by date range → Results update
- ✅ Click "View" → Modal shows transcript
- ✅ Click "Export CSV" → File downloads
- ✅ Pagination works (if >20 calls)

**Quick Navigation Test:**
1. Go to Data Center
2. Click 📞 icon next to a company
3. Should open Call Archives filtered by that company ✅

**Common Issues:**
- "No calls found" → Run seed script first
- Search doesn't work → Check text index (`/api/health`)
- Modal won't open → Check browser console
- CSV export empty → Check backend logs

---

### **Phase 3: System 3 - Smart Call Filter (30 min)**

**Access:**
1. Go to Company Profile of test company
2. Click "Spam Filter" tab

**Test Cases:**
- ✅ Dashboard loads with status banner (enabled/disabled)
- ✅ Toggle switch works (enable/disable filter)
- ✅ Click "+ Add Number" in Blacklist → Add `+15551234567`
- ✅ Number appears in blacklist ✅
- ✅ Click trash icon → Number removes ✅
- ✅ Click "+ Add Number" in Whitelist → Add `+15559876543`
- ✅ Number appears in whitelist ✅
- ✅ Click trash icon → Number removes ✅
- ✅ Uncheck "Check Global Spam Database" → Click "Save Settings" → Settings persist

**Phone Number Validation Test:**
- Try adding invalid format: `555-1234` → Should reject ✅
- Try adding valid E.164: `+15551234567` → Should accept ✅

**Common Issues:**
- Toggle doesn't work → Check backend logs (PUT/PATCH route)
- Numbers don't display → Data structure mismatch (FIXED, but verify)
- Changes don't persist → Redis cache issue (check logs)
- Can't add numbers → Check if routes exist (we added them!)

---

### **Phase 4: Integration Testing (30 min)**

**Test Cross-System Features:**

1. **Data Center Quick Actions:**
   - Go to Data Center
   - Find company in table

   - Click 🛡️ → Opens Spam Filter tab ✅

2. **Navigation Consistency:**
   - Visit every admin page (13 pages)
   - Verify "Call Archives" link exists ✅
   - Click it → Should go to Call Archives ✅

3. **Cross-System Data Flow:**
   - Make an AI call
   - Check AI Performance → New lookup appears ✅
   - Check Call Archives → New call record appears ✅
   - Add caller to blacklist
   - Make another call → Should be blocked (no AI processing) ✅
   - Check Call Archives → NO new record (blocked before AI) ✅

3. **Bug #9:** AI Performance - Auto-refresh memory leak (if tab switched multiple times)
4. **Bug #10:** AI Performance - Hardcoded 30s refresh interval (not configurable)
5. **Bug #13:** Call Archives - CSV injection protection can be enhanced
6. **Bug #14:** Call Archives - Large exports (10,000+ calls) may cause memory issues
7. **Bug #15:** Call Archives - Missing `totalPages` in pagination response

**These are "nice to have" improvements, not blockers.**

## 💡 TIPS FOR EFFICIENT TESTING

1. **Keep Backend Logs Open:** You'll need them for debugging
2. **Keep Browser Console Open:** F12 in Chrome/Firefox
3. **Test with Fresh Company:** Avoids old data confusion
4. **Use Seed Script:** Gives you realistic test data instantly
5. **Start Simple:** Test basic functionality before edge cases
6. **Document As You Go:** Note bugs immediately while fresh
7. **Use Health Endpoint:** Quick sanity check if things feel wrong

---

## 🚨 RED FLAGS (Stop & Debug)

**If you see these, something is wrong:**

1. **Health Check Status: "error" or "degraded"**
   - Fix before testing
   - Check MongoDB connection
   - Check Redis connection
   - Verify text index exists

2. **"No auth token found" on multiple pages**
   - Clear browser cookies
   - Re-login as admin
   - Check JWT token in localStorage

3. **All dashboards stuck loading**
   - Backend might be down
   - Check server logs
   - Restart server if needed

4. **Text search returns nothing (but data exists)**
   - Text index missing
   - Run health check to verify
   - Manually create index if needed

5. **Changes don't persist after page refresh**
   - Redis cache not clearing
   - MongoDB save failing
   - Check backend logs for errors

---
