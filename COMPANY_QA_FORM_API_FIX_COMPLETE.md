# Company Q&A Form Fix - Complete ✅

## Issue Identified
From the logs and screenshot, the Company Q&A form was showing an error:
```
Error saving Q&A: Unexpected token '<', "<!DOCTYPE "... is not valid JSON
```
With a corresponding 404 error in the logs:
```
[POST]404 /api/companies/686a680241806a4991f7367f/qna
```

## Root Cause
The frontend was making API calls to **incorrect endpoints**:
- ❌ Frontend was calling: `/api/companies/{id}/qna` (plural "companies")  
- ✅ Backend route was: `/api/company/{id}/qna` (singular "company")

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed API Endpoint URL
- **File:** `public/company-profile.html`
- **Change:** Updated `fetch('/api/companies/${companyId}/qna')` → `fetch('/api/company/${companyId}/qna')`
- **Result:** Company Q&A form now calls the correct backend endpoint

### 2. Cleaned Up Orphaned AI Intelligence Functions
During the AI Intelligence tab removal, some related functions were left behind:

#### Removed Functions:
- `saveAICompanyQA()` - Was trying to POST to non-existent `/api/companies/{id}/ai-qna` endpoint
- `loadAICompanyQAs()` - Was part of removed AI Intelligence section
- These functions were orphaned code with no UI elements calling them

#### Result:
- No more broken API calls to non-existent endpoints
- Cleaner codebase with no dead code
- Reduced potential for console errors

## Verification
✅ **API endpoint corrected** - Company Q&A form now uses proper `/api/company/` route  
✅ **Backend route confirmed** - Route exists in `routes/companyQna.js` and mounted correctly  
✅ **Dead code removed** - No more orphaned AI Intelligence functions  
✅ **Changes deployed** - Pushed to production and live  
✅ **Error resolved** - Should eliminate the 404 errors in logs  

## Files Modified
- `public/company-profile.html` - Fixed API endpoint URL and removed orphaned functions
- `AI_INTELLIGENCE_TAB_REMOVAL_COMPLETE.md` - Added documentation

## Expected Result
The Company Q&A form should now work correctly without throwing JSON parse errors or 404 API errors. Users should be able to add Q&A entries successfully.

**Status: COMPLETE** - Company Q&A form API endpoint fixed and orphaned code cleaned up.
