# Directory Profile Status Fix - Implementation Complete

## Problem
The directory page showed "Profile Setup Needed" even after completing the Overview tab, because:
1. Directory was only checking for `ownerName` and `ownerEmail` 
2. Overview tab saves business fields like `businessEmail`, `businessWebsite`, etc.
3. No real-time communication between profile and directory pages

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated Directory Logic (`public/js/directory.js`)
```javascript
// OLD: Only checked ownerName && ownerEmail
const hasOwnerInfo = company.ownerName && company.ownerEmail;

// NEW: Checks multiple completion criteria
const hasOwnerInfo = company.ownerName && company.ownerEmail;
const hasBusinessInfo = company.businessEmail || company.businessWebsite || company.description;
const hasAdditionalDetails = company.profileComplete || hasBusinessInfo || hasOwnerInfo;
```

### 2. Real-time Directory Updates
- Added localStorage communication between profile and directory pages
- When Overview tab saves, it signals directory to refresh
- Directory listens for `companyProfileUpdated` localStorage events

### 3. Backend Auto-Complete Logic (`routes/company.js`)
- When business details are saved, automatically sets `profileComplete = true`
- Checks for: `businessEmail`, `businessWebsite`, `description`, `businessPhone`, etc.

### 4. User Experience Improvements
- "Profile Setup Needed" → "Profile Complete" immediately after save
- "Complete Setup" button → "View Profile" button
- Green checkmark instead of warning icon
- No page refresh needed - updates in real-time

## Testing
1. Open directory in one tab
2. Open company profile in another tab
3. Fill out Overview tab and save
4. Directory should immediately update to show "Profile Complete"

## Files Modified
- `public/js/directory.js` - Updated profile completion logic
- `public/js/company-profile-modern.js` - Added localStorage signal
- `routes/company.js` - Auto-set profileComplete flag
- `models/Company.js` - Added business fields support

## Result
✅ Directory now correctly reflects profile completion status in real-time
✅ No more false "Profile Setup Needed" warnings
✅ Seamless user experience across tabs
