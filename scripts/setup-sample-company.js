                categoryQAs: `Q: My heater isn't working, what should I do?
A: I'm sorry to hear your heater isn't working! Let me help you troubleshoot. First, check if your thermostat is set to "heat" and the temperature is higher than the current room temperature. Also check if your circuit breaker has tripped. If these look good, you may need professional service. Would you like me to schedule an emergency repair visit?

Q: How much does a new air conditioner cost?
A: Air conditioner costs vary based on your home size and efficiency needs. For a typical San Francisco home, you can expect $3,500-$7,500 for a quality central AC system including installation. We offer free in-home estimates and financing options. Would you like to schedule a consultation?

Q: Do you provide emergency services?
A: Yes! We provide 24/7 emergency HVAC services throughout San Francisco and the Bay Area. Emergency service calls are $150, which goes toward any repair work. We typically arrive within 2 hours for emergencies. Would you like me to dispatch a technician?

Q: My air conditioner is making strange noises
A: Strange noises from your AC usually indicate a mechanical issue that needs attention. Common causes include loose parts, refrigerant leaks, or motor problems. I'd recommend scheduling a service call to prevent further damage. Our diagnostic fee is $95 and goes toward any repairs. Shall I book an appointment?

Q: How often should I change my air filter?
A: You should change your air filter every 1-3 months, depending on usage and filter type. During peak seasons (summer/winter), check monthly. Signs you need a new filter include reduced airflow, dusty home, or increased energy bills. We can set up a maintenance plan to remind you!

Q: What's included in your maintenance service?
A: Our comprehensive maintenance includes: cleaning and inspecting all components, checking refrigerant levels, testing electrical connections, lubricating moving parts, and a full system performance check. Annual maintenance costs $150 and can prevent 85% of common breakdowns.`,
