 * GLOBAL AI BRAIN SEEDING SCRIPT
 * ============================================================================
 * 
 * PURPOSE:
 * This script creates the world-class AI agent "brain" - a comprehensive
 * library of 103 conversation scenarios covering every possible human
 * interaction a receptionist might encounter.
 * 
 * WHAT MAKES THIS SPECIAL:
 * - Handles HUMAN CHAOS: distractions, off-topic talk, emotional states
 * - Understands INTENT, not just keywords
 * - Covers safety, emergencies, accessibility, and edge cases
 * - Professional, empathetic, and context-aware responses
 * - Designed for multi-industry use (HVAC, plumbing, medical, legal, etc.)
 * 
 * USAGE:
 * node scripts/seed-global-ai-brain.js
 * 
 * WHAT IT DOES:
 * 1. Creates a new GlobalInstantResponseTemplate v1.0.0
 * 2. Populates all 103 categories with scenarios, triggers, and responses
 * 3. Sets it as the active template
 * 4. ALL new companies will inherit this brain automatically
 * 
 * ARCHITECTURE:
 * Categories are organized by type:
 * - Emotional Intelligence (15 categories)
 * - Call Flow Management (10 categories)
 * - Scheduling & Appointments (12 categories)
 * - Payment & Billing (8 categories)
 * - Problem Resolution (10 categories)
 * - Safety & Emergencies (7 categories)
 * - Accessibility & Communication (8 categories)
 * - Customer Types (7 categories)
 * - Small Talk & Off-topic (10 categories)
 * - Edge Cases & Abuse (10 categories)
 * - Outbound & Follow-up (6 categories)
