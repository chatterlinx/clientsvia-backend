# FINAL ROUTE REGISTRATION COMPLETE

## Summary
Successfully completed the mounting of notification and event hooks routes in the main Express application.

## Changes Made

### 1. App.js Route Registration
- Added imports for both route modules:
  ```javascript
  const eventHooksRoutes = require('./routes/eventHooks');
  const notificationRoutes = require('./routes/notifications');
  ```

- Mounted routes with proper URL prefixes:
  ```javascript
  app.use('/api/event-hooks', eventHooksRoutes);
  app.use('/api/notifications', notificationRoutes);
  ```

- Added console logging for deployment verification:
  ```javascript
  console.log('âœ… Event Hooks routes registered at /api/event-hooks');
  console.log('âœ… Notification routes registered at /api/notifications');
  ```

### 2. Notification Routes Fix
- Fixed syntax error in `/routes/notifications.js` where `module.exports` was duplicated
- Added missing `notificationService` import
- Verified all route file imports work correctly
