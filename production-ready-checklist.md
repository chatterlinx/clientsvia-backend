## � **SYSTEM OVERVIEW**

### **What is ClientsVia?**
ClientsVia is a **multi-tenant AI agent platform** that manages companies across different global trade categories. Each company operates as an isolated tenant with their own AI agents, voice settings, booking flows, and business configurations.

### **Architecture Foundation**
- **Multi-Tenant Platform:** Each company gets isolated data and settings under unique `companyId`
- **AI Agent Management:** Companies can configure AI agents with custom prompts, voice synthesis (ElevenLabs), and behavior patterns
- **Trade Category System:** Companies are assigned to global trade categories (Plumbing, Electrical, HVAC, etc.) with category-specific knowledge bases
- **Booking Flow Management:** Each company has customizable booking and scheduling workflows
- **Voice Integration:** Twilio integration for phone-based AI interactions with company-specific greetings and responses

### **Data Isolation Model**
```
ClientsVia Platform
├── Company A (companyId: abc123)
│   ├── AI Settings (prompts, voice, behavior)
│   ├── Trade Categories (plumbing, electrical)
│   ├── Booking Flows (custom scheduling rules)
│   ├── Knowledge Base (company-specific Q&A)
│   ├── Contact Management
│   └── Analytics & Monitoring
├── Company B (companyId: def456)
│   ├── [Same structure, completely isolated]
│   └── ...
└── Global Settings
    ├── Trade Category Definitions
    ├── Platform Configuration
    └── Admin Controls
```

### **Key Business Value**
- **For Companies:** Complete AI agent solution with voice, booking, and customer management
- **For Platform:** Scalable SaaS model serving multiple industries under one codebase
- **For Users:** Industry-specific AI agents that understand trade-specific terminology and workflows

### **Critical Success Factors**
1. **Perfect Data Isolation:** Company A's data must NEVER leak to Company B
2. **Industry Customization:** Each trade category has specialized knowledge and workflows  
3. **Voice Quality:** ElevenLabs integration must work reliably for professional phone interactions
4. **Booking Accuracy:** Scheduling systems must handle complex trade-specific availability rules
5. **Multi-Channel Support:** Web dashboard + phone AI + future mobile apps

## 🚨 **HOTFIX LOG - July 26, 2025**

### **16:30 PST - CRITICAL PRODUCTION HOTFIX**
**Issue:** Automated sed-based console.log cleanup broke JavaScript syntax
**Impact:** Complete platform failure, syntax errors in company-profile.html and company-profile-modern.js
**Root Cause:** Used `sed` to remove console.log statements, left orphaned object literals and syntax
**Recovery Actions:**
1. Identified syntax errors through user report and browser console
2. Used `git checkout HEAD~1 -- public/company-profile.html public/js/company-profile-modern.js`
3. Committed restoration as hotfix (commit: 5206cc0e)
4. Updated coding manual with critical lesson learned
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED - Platform restored to working state
**Lesson:** Never use automated regex/sed for JavaScript modifications - manual only
**Next:** Resume console.log cleanup manually with syntax verification
