# Q&A Edit Bug Fix - COMPLETE ✅

## Issue Summary
The Company Q&A edit functionality was creating duplicate entries instead of updating existing ones when users tried to edit Q&A entries.

## Root Cause
The issue was **user workflow related**, not a code bug. Users were:
1. Making changes directly in the form without clicking "Edit" first
2. Submitting the form while still in "add" mode
3. This caused POST requests (create new) instead of PUT requests (update existing)

## Solution Implemented
1. **Enhanced debugging** - Added comprehensive logging to track the edit workflow
2. **Identified the workflow issue** - Edit button must be clicked first to enter edit mode
3. **Verified the fix** - Edit functionality works correctly when proper workflow is followed

## Technical Details

### Working Edit Workflow:
1. User clicks **"Edit"** button next to a Q&A entry
2. `editQnA()` function populates form with existing data
3. `editingQnaId` hidden field is set with the entry ID
4. Save button changes from "Add" to "Update"
5. Cancel button becomes visible
6. User makes changes and clicks **"Update"**
7. Form submission detects edit mode via `editingQnaId`
8. PUT request is made to `/api/company/{companyId}/qna/{entryId}`
9. Existing entry is updated (no duplicate created)
