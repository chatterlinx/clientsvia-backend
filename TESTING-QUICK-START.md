## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Tab not showing
**Solution:** Hard refresh browser (Cmd+Shift+R on Mac, Ctrl+Shift+R on Windows)

### Issue: "Loading..." never finishes
**Check:**
1. Is server running?
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Check Network tab for failed requests

### Issue: Can't save responses
**Check:**
1. Are you logged in?
2. Check browser console for validation errors
3. Verify MongoDB is connected (check server logs)

### Issue: Test matching not working
**Check:**
1. Do you have at least one enabled response?
2. Is your query similar to a trigger?
3. Check confidence threshold (should be 0.7 or lower)

### Issue: Templates not loading
**Check:**
1. Have templates been seeded? Run: `node scripts/seed-instant-response-templates.js`
2. Check server logs for errors

## 🎓 Understanding the System

### How Matching Works
1. User query comes in: `"when are you open"`
2. Matcher normalizes: `"when you open"`
3. Compares to all triggers: `"what are your hours"`
4. Calculates similarity using:
   - Exact match
   - Variation matching
   - Fuzzy matching
   - Term overlap
5. Returns best match if confidence > 70%

### Confidence Scores
- **90-100%:** Excellent match (exact or very close)
- **80-89%:** Good match (strong similarity)
- **70-79%:** Acceptable match (enough similarity)
- **< 70%:** No match (falls through to next priority)

### Categories
- **hours** - Business hours questions
- **location** - Address and directions
- **pricing** - Cost and pricing info
- **services** - What you offer
- **contact** - Phone, email, website
- **booking** - Appointments and reservations
- **emergency** - Urgent situations
- **other** - Everything else
