## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL REMINDERS

### **For Engineers:**

1. **NO EXTERNAL LLM** - Everything must be in-house, no OpenAI, no external APIs
2. **Sub-5ms Performance** - Instant responses MUST be fast, use pre-compiled regex
3. **Multi-Tenant Isolation** - Each company's data is completely isolated
4. **Audit Trail** - Log all changes (created, updated, deleted)
5. **Error Handling** - Never let the system crash, always provide fallback
6. **Testing First** - Write tests before deploying to production
7. **Documentation** - Comment everything, future you will thank you
8. **Security** - Validate all inputs, sanitize all outputs, authenticate all requests

## ðŸ’¡ TIPS FOR IMPLEMENTATION

### **Performance Optimization**
- Pre-compile all regex patterns in constructor
- Use `lean()` for all MongoDB queries
- Cache variation dictionary in memory
- Use async/await properly (don't block)
- Monitor performance with `Date.now()` timestamps

### **Code Quality**
- Follow existing code style in the project
- Use meaningful variable names
- Add JSDoc comments to all functions
- Keep functions small and focused (< 50 lines)
- DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) - extract common logic

### **Testing Strategy**
- Test happy path first
- Test edge cases (empty, null, very long)
- Test error conditions
- Test concurrent requests
- Test with real data (not just mocks)

### **Debugging**
- Use descriptive log messages
- Include context in all logs (routingId, companyId, etc.)
- Log timing data for performance tracking
- Use try-catch blocks everywhere
- Never swallow errors silently

## ðŸ“ž SUPPORT

If you encounter any issues during implementation:

1. **Check the specification** - All answers are in these 3 documents
2. **Review existing code** - Follow patterns from similar features
3. **Test incrementally** - Don't wait until everything is built
4. **Ask for clarification** - Better to ask than assume
