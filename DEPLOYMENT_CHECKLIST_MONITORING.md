# No manual migration required
```

### 3. Dependency Installation
```bash
cd /Users/marc/MyProjects/clientsvia-backend
npm install  # All required packages should already be installed
```

### 4. Server Restart
```bash
# Stop existing server
pm2 stop clientsvia-backend  # or kill existing process

# Start with monitoring
npm start
# or
node server.js
```

### 5. Verification Tests
```bash
# Run integration tests
node test-complete-integration.js

# Test API endpoints
node test-monitoring-api.js

# Manual UI verification in browser
```

## Health Checks

### Application Health
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/healthz
# Expected: {"ok":true}
```

### Monitoring System Health
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/monitoring/dashboard/[COMPANY_ID]
# Expected: JSON with monitoring metrics
```

### Database Health
```bash
# Check MongoDB connection
# Verify collections are created
# Confirm indexes are in place
```
